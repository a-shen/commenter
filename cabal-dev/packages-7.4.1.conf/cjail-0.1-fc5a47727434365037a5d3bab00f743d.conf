synopsis: Bindings for an Arch-Linux chroot-jail
description: This library provides a process-like inteface for executing
             arbitrary code in a jail (using the @cjail@ program).
             .
             @cjail@ uses Linux isolation mechanisms to confine processes.  These
             techniques are not novel, but it is important that they work
             properly.  Using @clone@ with the various @CLONE_NEW*@ flags, we
             give each confined process its own mount table and process ID
             namespace, as well as a new network stack with a new loopback device
             and no external interfaces.  Using a read-only bind-mount and the
             @tmpfs@ file system, we create a system image in which the only
             writable directory is an empty @/tmp@.  Using @cgroups@, we restrict
             the ability to create and use devices and consume resources.  With
             @pivot_root@ and @umount@, we hide filesystems outside of the
             read-only system image.  The previous actions all occur in a setuid
             root wrapper utility, which finally calls @setuid@ and drops
             capabilities before executing the confined process.
             .
             Currently this only works on Arch Linux. You can @cjail@ from:
