synopsis: Multi-app web platform framework
description: The rise of web platforms and their associated /apps/ represents a
             new way of developing and deploying software.  Sites such as
             Facebook and Yammer are no longer written by a single entity, but
             rather are freely extended by third-party developers offering
             competing features to users.
             .
             Allowing an app to access more user data allows developers to build
             more compelling products. It also opens the door to accidental or
             malicious breaches of user privacy. In the case of a website like
             Facebook, exposing access to a user's private messages would allow
             an external developer to build a search feature. Exciting!  But,
             another developer can take advantage of this feature to build an app
             that mines private messages for credit card numbers, ad keywords, or
             other sensitive data.
             .
             Frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Django, Yesod, etc. are geared
             towards building monolithic web sites. And, they are great for
             this! However, they are not designed for websites that integrate
             third-party code, and thus lack a good mechanism for building such
             multi-app platforms without sacrificing a user's security or an
             app's functionality.
             .
             Hails is explicitly designed for building web /platforms/, where it
             is expected that a site will comprise many mutually-distrustful
             components written by a variety of entities.  We built Hails around
             two core design principles.
             .
             * Separation of policy:
             Data access policies should be concisely specified alongside data
             structures and schemas, rather than strewn throughout the
             codebase in a series of conditionals. Code that implements this
             is called a /policy module/ in Hails (see "Hails.PolicyModule").
             .
             * Mandatory access control (MAC):
             Data access policies should be mandatory even once code has
             obtained access to data.  MAC lets platform components modules
             productively interact by sharing data, despite mutual distrust.
             Haskell lets us implement MAC at a fine grained level using the
             information flow control library "LIO".
             .
             A Hails platform hosts two types of code: /apps/ and /policy
             modules/. Apps encompass what would traditionally be considered
             controller and view logic. Policy modules are libraries that
             implement both the model and the data security policy. They are
             invoked directly by apps or other policy modules, but run with
             different privileges from the invoking code. Both apps and policy
             modules can be implemented by untrusted third parties, with the user
             only needing to trust the policy module governing the data in
             question. Separating of policy code from app code allows users to
             inspect and more easily unserstand the overall security provided by
             the system, while MAC guarantees that these policies are enforced
             in an end-to-end fashion.
